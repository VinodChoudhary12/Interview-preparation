Exception Handling
------------
1) Explain the concept of chained exceptions in Java.
Ans. -> one exception class/object will provide more information about exception class/object is called exception chaining

2) What is the purpose of the NullPointerException in Java, and how can you prevent it?
Ans. -> Null Pointer Exception is a kind of run time exception that is thrown when the java program attempts to use the object reference that that contains the null value.

3) Explain the difference between Error and Exception in Java.
Ans -> 	* Recovering from Error is not possible.	
		  We can recover from exceptions by either using try-catch block or throwing exceptions back to the caller.
		* All errors in java are unchecked type.	
		  Exceptions include both checked as well as unchecked type.
		* Errors are mostly caused by the environment in which program is running.	
		  Program itself is responsible for causing exceptions.
		* Errors can occur at compile time.
		* Unchecked exceptions occurs at runtime whereas   
		  checked exceptions occurs at comile time
		* They are defined in java.lang.Error package.	 
		  They are defined in java.lang.Exception package
		* Examples : java.lang.StackOverflowError, java.lang.OutOfMemoryError	
		  Examples : Checked Exceptions : SQLException, IOException Unchecked Exceptions : ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException, NullPointerException, ArithmeticException.
		  
4) How does the throws clause impact method overriding in Java?

5) Is it possible to throw checked exceptions from a static block?
Ans. -> In Java, it is not possible to throw checked exceptions directly from a static block. The reason is that a static block is a part of a class's initialization process, and throwing checked exceptions from there could lead to unhandled exceptions at the class level

6) What is the difference between ClassNotFoundException and NoClassDefFoundError?
Ans. -> ClassNotFoundException occurs when you try to load a class at runtime using Class.forName() or loadClass() methods and requested classes are not found in classpath. Most of the time this exception will occur when you try to run an application without updating the classpath with JAR files.
NoClassDefFoundError Now dwelling on the next exception that is NoClassDefFoundError occurs when the class was present during compile time and the program was compiled and linked successfully but the class was not present during runtime. It is an error that is derived from LinkageError. Linkage error occurs when a class has some dependencies on another class and the latter class changes after compilation of the former class.

7) Under what circumstances should we subclass an Exception?

8) Write the difference between throw, throws, and throwable in Java.
Ans. -> Throw: The throw keyword in Java is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code. We can throw either checked or unchecked exception. The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exceptions.
        
		Tgrows: In Java, when a method might encounter specific issues (exceptions) during its execution, it uses the throws keyword in its declaration to inform the calling code about these possibilities. The calling code must then handle these potential exceptions using try-catch blocks or acknowledge them with the throws keyword in its own declaration. This helps in building a structured approach to handle exceptional situations in a program.
		
		Throwable: is a super class for all types of errors and exceptions in java. This class is a member of java.lang package. Only instances of this class or it’s sub classes are thrown by the java virtual machine or by the throw statement. The only argument of catch block must be of this type or it’s sub classes. If you want to create your own customized exceptions, then your class must extend this class.

9) What are built-in Exceptions?
Ans. -> Built-in exceptions are exceptions that are pre-defined in Java Libraries. They are the most frequently occurring Exceptions. An example of a built-in exception can be ArithmeticException, it is a pre-defined exception in the Exception class of java.lang package. These can be further divided into 2 types: Checked Exception and Unchecked Exception.

10) Is it possible to throw an Exception inside a Lambda Expression’s body?
Ans. -> Yes, it is possible to throw an exception inside a lambda expression's body. However, there are some considerations and limitations. In a lambda expression, you can throw a checked exception if the functional interface associated with the lambda declares that it throws that exception.

11) Explain stack trace in Java. Why is it important in exception handling?
Ans. -> A stack trace, also called a stack backtrace or even just a backtrace, is a list of stack frames. These frames represent a moment during an application’s execution. A stack frame is information about a method or function that your code called. So the Java stack trace is a list of frames that starts at the current method and extends to when the program started.

12) Can we throw multiple exceptions in one throw statement?
Ans. -> No, in Java, you cannot throw multiple exceptions in a single throw statement. The throw statement is used to throw a single exception at a time. If you need to throw multiple exceptions, you should use multiple throw statements or handle the exceptions individually.


15) What are the benefits of try-with-resources?

16) Can we create Exception object? 
Ans.-> In Java, you can create an object of any class that extends Throwable, which includes both exceptions and errors. The common base class for exceptions is Exception, and you can create instances of subclasses of Exception to represent specific types of exceptions.

5. What is the difference between RuntimeException and Exception

6. What is the exception message format printed by JVM?
Ans. -> When an exception occurs in Java, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) typically prints a message to the console or log, providing information about the exception. The format of the exception message includes several pieces of information, such as the exception class name, a description of the exception, and sometimes additional details like the file and line number where the exception occurred.

7. What is the reason for raising an exception?

8. Why program is terminated when an exception is raised?

	Instead of creating a separate object for every requirement we can create only one object and we can reuse same object for every requirement. This approach improves performance and memory utilization.

8. What is the disadvantage of SCP?
	In SCP as several references pointing to the same object by using one reference if we are performing any changes the remaining references will be inflected. To prevent this compulsory String objects should be immutable. That is immutability is the disadvantage of SCP.
	
9. Why SCP like concept available only for the String but not for the StringBuffer?
	specially designed memory area like SCP to improve memory utilization and performance. But StringBuffer object is not commonly used object hence specially designed	memory area is not at all required.
	
10. Why String objects are immutable where as StringBuffer objects are mutable?
	In the case of String as several references pointing to the same object, by using one reference if we are allowed perform the change the remaining references will be impacted. To prevent this once we created a String object we can't perform any change in the existing object that is immutability is only due to SCP. But in the case of StringBuffer for every requirement we are creating a separate object will be created by using one reference if we are performing any change in the object the remaining references won't be impacted hence immutability concept is not require for the StringBuffer.
