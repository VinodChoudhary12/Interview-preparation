Type conversion & casting Interview Questions
------------------------------------------------

1. What is the meaning of type conversion & casting?
Ans.When we assign a value of one data type to the diô€ƒ¡erent data type then these two data types may not be compatible and needs a conversion. If
the data types are compatible (for example assigning int value to long) then java does automatic conversion and does not require casting. However if
the data types are not compatible then they need to be casted for conversion.
For example:
//here in the brackets we have mentioned long keyword, this is casting
double num = 10001.99;
long num2 = (long)num;

2. What are the rules we must follow in type conversion? 

3. What is the meaning of compatible types?

4. Which data type is incompatible type among all primitive types?

5. Draw primitive type auto conversion chart? 

6. Is "type casting" meant for converting incompatible type or height range data type?

7. What will happen if result value is greater than casting data type range?

8. What is the short-cut formule for type casting in reducing high range value?

9. Can you explain when will you get below compile time errors?
	1. CE: Incompatible types 
	2. CE: possible loss of precisio/ext
	3. CE: inconvertible types

10. Can we assign (long to float) & (float to long)? 

11. Can we assign (char literal to int variable) & (int literal to char variable)?

12. When "?" is stored in char varlable?

13. Can we assign 10.5 to float variable?

14. Can we assign 1234567891234567 number to long type variable? 

15. What types of literals are only allowed to assign to lesser range data type variable?

16. Identify will below statements compiled?
	a. byte b1 = 50;	3) char ch1 = 97;	5) boolean
	bo = 1;
	b. byte b2 = 'a';	4) float f1 = 10.5; 6) byte b3 = 128; 
	
17. What is the diff between primitive type conversion & referenced type conversion?

18. When will two classes are said to be compatible? 

19. What is the meaning of upcasting & downcasting?

20. When will we get ClassCastException?

21. What is the use of instanceof operator?

22. What is the difference between cast operator & instanceof operator?
