WRAPPER CLASSES
-------------------
1. What is the meaning of wrapping? 
Ans. -> if we want to convert primitive to object(ref) when be will use wrapper class.

2. What is the use of wrapper class?

3. How many wrapper classes do we have?

4. What is a Number class, why is it an abstract class?

5. What is the super class for Character & Boolean classes?

6. What are the 6 conversions we can do using wrapper classes?
Ans. -> primitive to object.
		object to primitive.
		primitive to string.
		string to primitive.
		object to string.
		string to object

7. What are the constructors and methods do we have in all wrapper classes for performing all 6 conversions? 
Ans. -> valueOf().
		typeValue();
		parsetype();
		toString();

Auto Boxing And Unboxing Interview Questions
--------------------------------------------

1. What is the meaning of auto boxing and unboxing?
Ans. -> auttomatic conversion of primitive to wrapper object by compiler is called auto boxing.

	Ans. -> int...
	
	5) method is overloaded with (Integer...) & (int...) parameters 
	Ans. -> int...

	6) method is overloaded with (Object) & (int...) parameters
	Ans. -> int...

12. Can we pass wrapper class object as argument to switch?
Ans. -> yes

13. Can we pass String class object as argument to switch?
ans. -> yas 1.7

14. Can we do arithmetic operations using wrapper classes?

15. Write a program to add two integer numbers without using primitive variables?

16. In place of primitive types, Is it recommended to use wrapper classes in arithmetic operations?

----------------------------------------------------------------
1. What is Casting? 
Ans. -> to converting one data type to another data type is called casting.

2. What are the advantages of Auto Boxing?

3. What is Implicit Casting?

4.What is Explicit Casting?

5. How can you convert a String to a wrapper class?
Ans. -> using valueOf() merhod.

6. How can you convert a String to a primitive type?
Ans. -> using parsetype().

7. When would you need to convert a String to a character array?

8. What is the best way to convert a String to a primitive type value?

9. What do you understand by boxing and unboxing?

10. Is it possible to convert a Double to a Boolean? If yes, then how?

11. Is it possible to convert a string to a boolean? If yes, then how?

12. What’s the difference between parseInt() and valueOf() methods? Which one would you prefer using?

13. Are all wrapper classes immutable?

14.What does the compareTo method do?

15. What happens if there is no matching wrapper class when converting from a primitive to a wrapper class?

Q56. How can we use primitive data types as objects?
Ans: Primitive data types like int can be handled as objects by the use of their respective wrapper classes. For example, Integer is a wrapper class for
primitive data type int. We can apply di􀃡erent methods to a wrapper class, just like any other object.
